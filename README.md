## •Description
Utopika design studio´s website. It has some features that I tried to implement “from scratch” to be able to practice, such as filter by tags, access to the Instagram API, the functionality to switch between languages and others. I'm currently remodeling it to use the Styled Components library.

## •Challenges
At one point in the project it became very difficult to organize element classes using css files, so i started implementing the styled components. I also had some difficulty accessing the instagram API and managing its possible errors.

## •Technologies and Libraries
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Styled Components

## •How to run the application
- Clone the repository on your machine
- In the terminal, install the application's dependencies: `npm install`
- Now just put the application to run!: `npm start`
