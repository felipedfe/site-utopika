To that end, we created new layouts for its video graphics package in order to be versatile and adapt to consumption on networks, without losing the Mongabay identity.",
        text2: "We made an essential graphics package that can be easily used in Adobe Premiere through a simple interface and with some customization options for the editor.",
        text3: "The graphics are automated to adapt to the information that is placed through expressions that control the size of the text boxes, number of lines, etc., causing the editor to change as few properties as possible.",
        text4: "We made vertical and horizontal versions so that the information behaved similarly in both formats without needing adaptations by the editorials. It was a great partnership with Mongabay's video coordinator, Lucia Torres, so that the graphic package had the best use internally.",
