        julia: `<strong>Julia Lima</strong> – Designer, illustrator, and motion designer, she has worked in TV, magazines, publishing, and production companies before realizing that design is transversal — what drives her is the theme and the people she builds with.
        <br>For over a decade, she has worked at the intersection of design, storytelling, and social impact, creating projects that amplify voices and foster genuine connections. Her experience extends to exhibition design and game design, translating complex topics into immersive and accessible experiences.
        <br>She built Utópika not just as a studio, but as a workspace that reflects her values. She leads teams and projects always striving to unite clarity, imagination, and impact, balancing the challenges of communication, business, motherhood, and the world she wants to help build.
        <br>To her, design only makes sense when it is committed to reality and has the courage to interfere with it.`,

        rachel: `<strong>Rachel Gepp</strong> – Advertising professional, designer, and illustrator. She believes in communication as a tool for transformation and has built her career with over twenty years of experience in communications, combining strategy and action to shape visual narratives that mobilize and make an impact.
        <br>With a strategic outlook and strong coordination skills, she merges creative intelligence with field experience. At Utópika, she creates innovative projects for social, cultural, and environmental organizations that not only communicate but also question, provoke, and inspire change.
        <br>She specializes in creating visual identities and graphic content that translate complex issues for diverse audiences. Her work blends design, science communication, and social impact.
        <br>To her, design is discourse, and communicating with honesty is a political act.`,
